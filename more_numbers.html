<h2 id="levels">Levels</h2>

<p>Levels are already a well-established paradigm in OpenStreetMap.
This can be seen in maps like <a href="https://openlevelup.net">OpenLevelUp</a> and <a href="http://openstationmap.org">OpenStationMap</a>.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, our tools are geared towards a 2D-representation of the world.
For a reason:
for by far most of the world only the surface is interesting.</p>

<p>This has a downside where in reality locations are packed on multiple stories:
We have piles of data there that are difficult to edit or even view.</p>

</figure>

<p>It is possible to get level-by-level through the data.
In a first step, we can look <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nxA">which levels exist</a>:</p>
<pre>
( node({{bbox}})[level];
  way({{bbox}})[level];
  rel({{bbox}})[level]; );
make levels_here level_list=set("{" + t["level"] + "}");
out;
</pre>
<p>This works similar to <a href="numbers.html#discussion">the power line example</a> for a list of all values.</p>

<p>We can then easily fetch the data level-by-level:</p>
<pre>
( node({{bbox}})[level={{value}}];
  way({{bbox}})[level={{value}}];
  rel({{bbox}})[level={{value}}]; );
(._; &gt;;);
out;
</pre>
<p>Please replace the <em>{{value}}</em> with the actual level.
Let us briefly walk through the query:
The first three lines employ two rather well-known features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The queries <em>node({{bbox}})[level={{value}}]</em> resp. with <em>way</em> or <em>rel</em> select all elements
within the supplied bounding box and with a tag <em>level</em>.</li>
<li>They are wrapped in an <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Union">union</a> statement, written as a pair of parentheses.
This statement produces as result all objects that are in one or more results of the statements inside.</li>
<li>In the fourth line, there are two statements wrapped again in an union statement.
The first one is more or less auxiliary:
<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Item"><em>._</em></a> reproduces the last result.
This assures that a copy of the previous result is in the union result.
The second one consists of one character, <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Recurse_down_.28.3E.29"><em>&gt;</em></a>.
It returns all node members of ways in the previous result, all node and way members of relations in the previous result,
and all nodes that are members of the just added ways.
Altogether it ensures that we have resolved all dependencies necessary to get the geometries of the previous result.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="relative_values">Relative Values</h2>

<p>But what if we have an element and would like to get only those elements on the same level?
In our example: you would like to know everything about the "RER D" part of the station.</p>

<p>To prepare the answer,
I would like to use <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nxy">a slightly fancier variant</a> of the last query:</p>
<pre>
make level_param val={{value}} -&gt;.param;
( node({{bbox}})[level](if:t["level"]==param.set(t["val"]));
  way({{bbox}})[level](if:t["level"]==param.set(t["val"]));
  rel({{bbox}})[level](if:t["level"]==param.set(t["val"])); );
(._; &gt;;);
out;
</pre>
<p>The value now needs to be set only once.
We have a short look at the details.
The first line is a <em>make</em> statement.
The only uncommon thing is that it ends in <em>-&gt;.param</em>.
This stores the result instead of the standard place to a new place <em>param</em>.</p>

<p>In the second to fourth line this result is taken as input to the aggregator <em>set</em>,
hence written as <em>param.set(...)</em>.
This is the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Union_and_set">aggregator <em>set</em></a> as known before
but reading from the previous result <em>param</em>.</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nxD">you can use a tag value</a> from a previous result as search criteria:</p>
<pre>
node({{bbox}})[name="Gare de Lyon RER D"]-&gt;.param;
( node({{bbox}})[level](if:t["level"]==param.set(t["level"]));
  way({{bbox}})[level](if:t["level"]==param.set(t["level"]));
  rel({{bbox}})[level](if:t["level"]==param.set(t["level"])); );
(._; &gt;;);
out;
</pre>
<p>This finds not only the node representing part "RER D" but also all the elements on the same level.</p>

<h2 id="comparing_tags">Comparing Tags</h2>

<p>There is more than one tag to express vertical position in OpenStreetMap.
The oldest one is <em>layer</em>.
We are curious <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nCP">if there are elements where the tags <em>level</em> and <em>layer</em> differ</a>:</p>
<pre>
( node({{bbox}})[level][layer](if:t["level"]!=t["layer"]));
  way({{bbox}})[level][layer](if:t["level"]!=t["layer"]);
  rel({{bbox}})[level][layer](if:t["level"]!=t["layer"]); );
(._; &gt;;);
out;
</pre>
<p>This query doesn't contain anything new
but reuses features we already know.
The only notable feature is the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Equality_and_inequality">non-equality operator</a>.
Nonetheless this generalizes to a standard approach to compare object values within the same element.</p>

<p>That an element has different values for the tags <em>level</em> and <em>layer</em>
is not necessary the error to fix.
According to <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:layer">the documentation of the <em>layer</em> tag</a>,
a <em>level</em> tag belongs to indoor elements while a <em>layer</em> tags belongs to outdoor elements.
Hence, it is rather suspect if an element has both tags.
For convenience, <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nCZ">a query to find elements with both tags</a>:</p>
<pre>
( node({{bbox}})[level][layer];
  way({{bbox}})[level][layer];
  rel({{bbox}})[level][layer]; );
(._; &gt;;);
out;
</pre>

<p>Are in a complex scenario like this neighbourhood in Paris the layers properly set?
We cannot check whether elements are tagged in the wrong vertical order,
not without local knowledge.
But we can check whether elements with the same <em>layer</em> value intersect
- this is always an error.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nD5">complete approach</a> is admittedly slow:</p>
<pre>
way({{bbox}})[layer]-&gt;.all;
foreach.all(
  node(w)-&gt;.children;
  (
    way.all(around:0)(if:t["layer"]==u(t["layer"]));
    - way.all(bn.children);
  );
  (._; .result;)-&gt;.result;
);
.result out geom;
</pre>
<p>Also, the result is too dense to make sense of it.
We will find a workaround in the next step.
Nonetheless, I would like to explain how it works:</p>
<p>The first line is a standard query for <em>ways</em> in the given <em>{{bbox}}</em> with an value for <em>[layer]</em>.
Notable is the syntax to keep the result in a named bucket <em>all</em>. It is <em>-&gt;.all</em>.</p>
<p>In the second line begins a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#For-each_loop_.28foreach.29">foreach</a> block.
It loops over the elements from the just-filled bucket <em>all</em>.
The loop variable is the standard bucket <em>_</em>.
Thus we have inside the loop both the loop element (in <em>_</em>) and the set of elements as a whole (in <em>all</em>) adressable.</p>
<p>We skip the third line for a moment.
The fourth to seventh line is a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Difference"><em>difference</em> block</a>.
In total, we want to keep only those ways that are close to the loop element but do not share a node with it.
For this purpose we first collect in line five all ways that are close to the loop element.
Then in line six, we cut out all elements that share a common node with the loop element.
We need for line six the set of of nodes that are members of the loop element.
We cannot easily collect them right here because that would interfere with the difference statement.
Thus we collect them before the difference statement in line three and store them to another named bucket, <em>children</em>.</p>
<p>Line five is a query with multiple conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#By_input_set_.28.setname.29">The condition <em>.all</em></a> restricts the potential results to ways from the bucket <em>all</em>.
This speeds up the query because we only need to check properties of already known elements
and not collect a potentially large set of candidates from disk.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Relative_to_other_elements_.28around.29">The condition <em>(around:0)</em></a> restricts the result set further to those ways that intersect the loop element.</li>
<li>The condition <em>[layer]</em> restricts the result to elements that have a layer tag.</li>
<li>The condition <em>(if:t["layer"]==u(t["layer"]))</em> further restricts the result to only those elements that have the same layer as the loop element.
Note the expression <em>u(t["layer"])</em>: this is the aggregator <em>u</em> over the content of the standard bucket.
The standard bucket contains at this point the loop element.
Thus we get the <em>layer</em> value of that element.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the line <em>(._; .result;)-&gt;.result;</em> is a sequence of three statements
that together collect all the results in a common result bucket named <em>result</em>.
To print the result (instead of printing a single random loop element)
we prepend <em>out geom</em> by the name of the bucket to print from, i.e. <em>.result</em>.</p>

<p>We can get the whole thing both faster and less packed by <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nCT">inspecting layer-by-layer</a>:</p>
<pre>
make param val=-2 -&gt;.param;
way({{bbox}})(if:t["layer"]==param.u(t["val"]))-&gt;.all;
foreach.all(
  node(w)-&gt;.children;
  (
    way.all(around:0)(if:t["layer"]==param.u(t["val"]));
    - way.all(bn.children);
  );
  (._; .result;)-&gt;.result;
);
.result out geom;
</pre>
<p>This query yields all results for <em>layer</em> equals <em>-2</em>.
You can adjust the value easily in line one by exchanging <em>-2</em> to something different.
According to the wiki, integral values from <em>-5</em> to <em>5</em> shall be used.
You can check will values really exist
if you adapt a query like <a href="#levels">the value listing for <em>level</em></a>.</p>

<h2 id="semicolon">Lists in Tags</h2>

<p>Let us return to the <em>level</em> tag.
What about elements which have multiple levels?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we do not have any features that break up strings so far.
Thus the best I can offer is <a href="http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nD6">the regular expression query to at least find where they are</a>:</p>
<pre>
( node({{bbox}})[level~";"];
  way({{bbox}})[level~";"];
  rel({{bbox}})[level~";"]; );
out geom;
</pre>
<p>A further analysis of the situation shows that only level-changing features like steps and elevators have more than one level here.
Excellent tagging!</p>

<p>This is one of the three kinds of almost-number values I have addressed last week.
The other two are numeric values with units and those with special syntax.
I still would very much appreciate use cases for those kinds of values.
This is necessary to figure out which features to develop next.</p>
