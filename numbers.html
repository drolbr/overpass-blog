<p>First of all, I would like to acknowledge nebulon42 for <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2017-March/077648.html">giving feedback</a>.
I have added the example to <a href="dark_pois.html">last week's blog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="power">A Powerful Example</h2>

<p>We would like to make a map of the long distance power transmission lines,
like the following one:</p>

<figure>
<img src="power_netherlands.jpg" style="width:20em;"/>
<figcaption>Long distance power transmission lines in the Netherlands</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nrK">collect with a regular expression query</a> all lines with more than 100 kV:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
area[name="Nederland"];
way(area)[power=line][voltage~"^[1-9].....$"];
out geom;
</pre>
<p>But this is hard to read for all those that do not work all day with regular expressions.
In addition, this would not match hypothetical transmission lines of 1000 kV or more.
We would rather like to use the familar greater-equal operator:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
area[name="Nederland"];
way(area)[power=line](if:t[voltage]&gt;=100000);
out geom;
</pre>
<p><a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nrL">This query</a> basically works.
However, we get now more results than before.
What is going on here?
What is going wrong?
To enable you to figure our yourself is the purpose of this blog post.</p>

<h2 id="maxspeed">Maximum Speed</h2>

<p>We start to <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nrR">have a look</a> at the <em>maxspeed</em> tag on motorways around Cologne:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
way({{bbox}})[highway=motorway]
  [maxspeed](if:t[maxspeed]&gt;120);
out geom;
</pre>
<p>Let us walk through the syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>way</em>: We search for all ways</li>
<li><em>({{bbox}})</em>: within the bounding box filled-in by Overpass Turbo</li>
<li><em>[highway=motorway]</em>: that have a tag with key <em>highway</em> and value <em>motorway</em></li>
<li><em>[maxspeed]</em>: and have a tag with key <em>maxspeed</em> and arbitrary value</li>
</ul>
<p>The new part is <em>(if:t[maxspeed]&gt;120)</em>.
Again <em>(if:...)</em>is the shell to select exactly those elements for which the condition is true.
The expression <em><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Tag_value_and_generic_value_operators">t[maxspeed]</a></em> evaluates for each element to the value of its maxspeed tag.
It would evaluate to the empty string for elements without maxspeed tag
but we have already narrowed down to those with maxspeed tag.
<em><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Less.2C_less-equal.2C_greater.2C_and_greater-equal">&gt;</a></em> compares the expressions on both sides.
Finally <em>120</em> evaluates always to the number 120.
All in all, we ask for all ways
that have as <em>maxspeed</em> tag value a value greater than 120.</p>

<p>More than expected of the roads seem to allow for high speed.
But <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nrO">a simple cross-check</a> should make you suspicious:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
way({{bbox}})[highway=motorway]
  [maxspeed](if:t[maxspeed]&gt;200);
out geom;
</pre>

<p>Apparently, there is something going wrong here.
This is why there are <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nrP">some extra tools</a> to avoid these things:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
way({{bbox}})[highway=motorway]
  [maxspeed](if:!is_number(t[maxspeed]));
out geom;
</pre>
<p>Compare to the previous query!
The new part is <em>!is_number(...)</em>.
The expression <em><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Number_check_and_normalizer">is_number(...)</a></em> evaluates the value it gets to whether it is a number.
The shrek is <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Boolean_Negation">logical negation</a>.
All in all we ask here for all ways
that have as <em>maxspeed</em> tag value a value that is not a number.</p>

<h2 id="nonnumbers">What has gone wrong?</h2>

<p>We get quite a large result, but not necessary a clue which values exist.
To solve this <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nrQ">we can employ</a> another new tool:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
way({{bbox}})[highway=motorway]
  [maxspeed](if:!is_number(t[maxspeed]));
make taginfo_of_cologne values=set(t[maxspeed]);
out;
</pre>
<p>The new thing here is the third line.
It consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>make</em>: The command we use.
Two two commands <em><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#The_make_statement">make</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#The_convert_statement">convert</a></em> will be in all details subject to a later blogpost.</li>
<li><em>taginfo_of_cologne</em>: an arbitrary identifier.
This becomes the name of the element in the result.</li>
<li><em>values=set(t[maxspeed])</em>: The part that defines what tags that element gets.
In particular, <em>values=...</em> instructs the make statement to set the tag with key <em>values</em> to the value that is the result of the right hand side expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>The expression <em>set(t[maxspeed])</em> does the real job:
<em><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Union_and_set">set(...)</a></em> is a so-called <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Aggregators">aggregator</a>.
The job of an aggregator is to evaluate its argument once for each element in the previous result
and then to produce a single string that somehow combines all the results.
The particular behaviour of <em>set</em> is to append all found values in alphabetically order separated by semi-colons.</p>

<p>Altogether, we go over all the found ways,
look at their <em>maxspeed</em> tag
and tack all found values together with semi-colons.
The result goes in a specified tag of a dedicated element.
This should result in:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
  &lt;taginfo_of_cologne id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tag k=&quot;values&quot; v=&quot;none;signals&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/taginfo_of_cologne&gt;
</pre>

<p>Why have these values interfered with the <em>&gt;200</em> query?
At the moment, the greater-than comparsion tries to be smart:
If it has a number on both sides then it compares both sides as a number.
If one or both sides are strings that cannot be interpreted as number
then these strings are compared lexicographically.
And both <em>none</em> and <em>signals</em> are in order after <em>200</em>,
thus they pass the filter.</p>

<p>If this behavious makes sense depends on whether there are use cases for string comparison.
If you know of any such use cases then please send them.
Otherwise we may have the latitude to change that behaviour such that the naive approach works.
The hard part is to get the behaviour both intuitive and logically consistent, not the implementation.
And if a thing is intuive depends on the use cases.</p>

<h2 id="peaks">Maximum Peak</h2>

<p>Another application of numbers in tags is the elevation tag <em>ele</em>.
We would like to find the highest peak in a given region.
A region with quite high peaks in Germany is Baden-Württemberg.</p>

<p>With the approach from the previous section we only can find quite high peaks:</p>
<pre>
area[name="Baden-Württemberg"];
node(area)[natural=peak](if:t[ele]>1000);
out geom;
</pre>
<p>In the result we have <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/783669174">the Sickersberg</a>,
although it is only 978 meters high.
What has gone wrong?</p>

<p>The tag value <em>978 m</em> is not a number because it contains the explicit unit <em>m</em>.
As a string, <em>978 m</em> is lexicographically after <em>1000</em>.
Thus, the engine has included this node in the result.
We should <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nsR">take this into account</a>:</p>
<pre>
area[name="Baden-Württemberg"];
node(area)[natural=peak](if:number(t[ele])>1000);
out geom;
</pre>

<p>After fixing the issue of not-numbers,
we still want not all quite high but only the highest peak:</p>
<pre>
area[name="Baden-Württemberg"];
node(area)[natural=peak](if:number(t[ele])>1000);
node._(if:t[ele]==max(t[ele]));
out;
</pre>
<p>We <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nsV">achieve this</a> with a standard trick from mathematics.
Let us walk through the query:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>area[name="Baden-Württemberg"]</em>: Selects all areas (actually only one) with name <em>Baden-Württemberg</em>.</li>
<li><em>node(area)[natural=peak](if:number(t[ele])>1000)</em>:
Selects all nodes within the given area (filter <em>(area)</em>)
that have a tag with key <em>natural</em> and value <em>peak</em>
and have a tag with key <em>ele</em> that evaluates to a number bigger than <em>1000</em>.</li>
<li><em>node._(if:t[ele]==max(t[ele]))</em>:
This is our mathematical trick.
The elements with the biggest values (precise: with the maximum big values) are all those elements whois value is equal to the maximum of all values.
This is written in three details:
  <ul>
  <li><em>._</em>: This filter means we take only the result from the last step as input.</li>
  <li><em>(if:t[ele]==...)</em>: We only want elements for which the tag wiith key <em>ele</em> has a value equal to the right hand size expression.</li>
  <li><em>max(t[ele])</em>: This is again an <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Aggregators">aggregator</a>.
  The aggregator <em>max(...)</em> evaluates its argument for each element of the input set
  and returns the maximum of all found values.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><em>out</em>: Send the results back to the client, i.e. to us.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nrN">what values are the problem?</a></p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
area[name="Baden-Württemberg"];
node(area)[natural=peak](if:is_tag(ele) &amp;&amp; !is_number(t[ele]));
out geom;
</pre>
<p>Reduced to the essential:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
area[name="Baden-Württemberg"];
node(area)[natural=peak](if:is_tag(ele) &amp;&amp; !is_number(t[ele]));
make debug values=set(t[ele]);
out;
</pre>

<h2 id="discussion">Your Move</h2>

<p>Walking through the list of the last query we see that there are two kinds of values we need to care for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Values with explicit unit: <em>1005 m</em></li>
<li>Values with comma as decimal separator: <em>1011,7</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We proceed with another example to collect more problem classes.</p>

<p>Let us revisit the query from the beginning:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
area[name="Nederland"];
way(area)[power=line](if:t[voltage]&gt;=100000);
out geom;
</pre>
<p>We now know that the problem are the non-numeric values.
And <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/ntd">we can fix</a> that:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
area[name="Nederland"];
way(area)[power=line](if:number(t[voltage])&gt;=100000);
out geom;
</pre>
<p>But we are now interested in the non-numeric values:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
area[name="Nederland"];
way(area)[power=line](if:is_tag(voltage) &amp;&amp; !is_number(t[voltage]));
make debug values=set(t[voltage]);
out geom;
</pre>
<p>The list looks odd:
<em>380000</em> appears multiple times, and <em>0</em> is somewhere in between, as opposed to any imaginable order.
The reason are ways like <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/87345533">this</a> with a tag value <em>380000;110000</em>.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/nte">can overcome</a> that problem:</p>
<pre style="background-color:yellow;">
area[name="Nederland"];
way(area)[power=line](if:is_tag(voltage) &amp;&amp; !is_number(t[voltage]));
make debug values=set("{" + t[voltage] + "}");
out geom;
</pre>
<p>This puts curly brackets around each value and makes values with semi-colons distinguishable.</p>

<p>Ways with semi-colons are the third class of values we need to keep in mind.
And do not forget special values like <em>none</em> and <em>signals</em>.</p>

<P>I have two questions I would like to survey for:
How shall we treat these four kinds of special values in Overpass API?
Treating everything that has digits as a number does not solve the problem,
because it would paint over e.g. semi-colon values instead of pointing at the problem.</p>

<p>The second question is:
What to make out of the less and greater operators?
I will open next weeks blog post with a short history of comparison functions in programming languages.
None of the concepts is without downsides.
Which one is best depends on use cases.
In particular:
if you want to retain comparison for strings then please tell me use cases.</p>
