<h1>Some Performance Hints</h1>

<h2 id=""></h2>

<p>Of the examples' pages I have checked the section <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_API_by_Example#Geometry_and_Topology">about Understanding Geometry and Topology</a>.</p>

<p>While most of the examples are already perfectly fine,
I would like to analyse further the first example:</p>
<pre>
[bbox:{{bbox}}];
rel[type=multipolygon];
foreach -> .a (
  way(r.a:outer);
  way._(if:count(ways) > 1);
  rel.a(bw);
  out;
);
</pre>
<p>The query works, but it is slow.</p>

<p>First of all, I have been more surprised by the number of results <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/oLq">in the sample region</a>.
This is relatively unusual, but of course the query should work everywhere.
In <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/oLp">a random different region</a> are only 12 or so results.</p>

<p>To make finding multipolygons in Rome faster,
I would like to discuss where the runtime is used,
how you can find out,
and what you can do to make the query faster.</p>

<p>Because currently the server does not tell you how long a query takes,
you can check only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall-clock_time">wall-clock time</a>.
I think I will expose more execution details
once I have figured out
how to do so in a brief but meaningful way.
Second, the wall-clock time is good enough to detect large delays.
You cannot spot reliably the difference between 2 and 3 seconds runtime.
But you can discriminate between 2 minutes runtime and 3 minutes runtime.</p>

<p>A good approach is to execute the query step-by-step
and to observe where it starts to take significant amounts of time.</p>

<p>The first line that is executed is the second line.
To <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/oLu">cross-check</a> whether the line does something useful,
we can add a minimal <em>out</em> statement afterwards.
Minimal out statements are <em>out ids</em> or <em>out count</em>.
Both do not need any disk activity and are therefore always very fast.</p>
<pre>
[bbox:{{bbox}}];
rel[type=multipolygon];
out count;
</pre>

<p>As the first request is a matter of seconds,
we can add one further statement.
Now it is a little bit tricky to identify the next statement.
I take the <em>foreach</em> statement,
because the other statements all depend on what the foreach statement delivers as loop element.</p>
<pre>
[bbox:{{bbox}}];
rel[type=multipolygon];
foreach -> .a (
);
</pre>
<p><a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/oLx">This</a> is still relatively fast.</p>

<p>Now the loop <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/oLy">can be filled</a>:</p>
<pre>
[bbox:{{bbox}}];
rel[type=multipolygon];
foreach -> .a (
  way(r.a:outer);
);
</pre>

<p>It is time for a first optimization trial.
The <em>recurse</em> statement inside the foreach loop does need disk activity.
There are good chances that the query is faster if we replace multiple executions within the loop
with a single execution before the loop.
For this purpose, we store the result in an intermediate set <em>w</em>
and reuse that set in the foreach loop to avoid the disk activity.</p>
<pre>
[bbox:{{bbox}}];
rel[type=multipolygon];
way(r:outer)->.w;
foreach -> .a (
  way.w(r.a:outer);
);
</pre>
<p><a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/oLA">This</a> turns out to be much slower.
At the moment, I'm pretty sure that I have hit aan uninteded bug,
but I have not yet investigated that further.
The bottomline is that this optimization does not make sense at least in this case.</p>

<p>We back out to the previous step
and <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/oLB">add the next line</a> of the original request:</p>
<pre>
[bbox:{{bbox}}];
rel[type=multipolygon];
foreach -> .a (
  way(r.a:outer);
  way._(if:count(ways) > 1);
);
</pre>
<p>The wall-clock time has been 17 seconds in my test run.</p>

<pre>
[bbox:{{bbox}}];
rel[type=multipolygon];
foreach -> .a (
  way(r.a:outer);
  way._(if:count(ways) > 1);
  rel.a(bw);
);
</pre>
<p>The wall-clock time has been about 90 seconds in my test run.</p>

<p>...</p>
<pre>
[bbox:{{bbox}}];
rel[type=multipolygon];
foreach -> .a (
  way(r.a:outer);
  rel.a(if:count(ways) > 1);
);
</pre>
(45 Sek)

<pre>
[bbox:{{bbox}}];
rel[type=multipolygon];
foreach -> .a (
  way(r.a:outer);
  way._(if:count(ways) > 1);
  ( rel.a(bw);
    .result; )->.result;
);
.result out;
</pre>
